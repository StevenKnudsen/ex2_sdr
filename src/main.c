/******************************************************************************
 * This project provides three demo applications.  A simple blinky style project,
 * a more comprehensive test and demo application, and a TCP echo demo.
 * The mainSELECTED_APPLICATION setting is used to select between
 * the three
 *
 * If mainSELECTED_APPLICATION = BLINKY_DEMO the simple blinky demo will be built.
 * The simply blinky demo is implemented and described in main_blinky.c.
 *
 * If mainSELECTED_APPLICATION = FULL_DEMO the more comprehensive test and demo
 * application built. This is implemented and described in main_full.c.
 *
 * This file implements the code that is not demo specific, including the
 * hardware setup and FreeRTOS hook functions.
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 * NOTE: Linux will not be running the FreeRTOS demo threads continuously, so
 * do not expect to get real time behaviour from the FreeRTOS Linux port, or
 * this demo application.  Also, the timing information in the FreeRTOS+Trace
 * logs have no meaningful units.  See the documentation page for the Linux
 * port for further information:
 * https://freertos.org/FreeRTOS-simulator-for-Linux.html
